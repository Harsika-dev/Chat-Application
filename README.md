This is a chat application built using React, Socket.io and NodeJS. Built as a simple version of Whatsapp Clone, it has the following features:

1) The user can either login using an existing id or create a new id for accessing the web-app.
2) The UI features a side bar with a Conversations and Contacts tab.
3) The Contacts tab lists all the existing contacts. The user can create a new contact by entering the name and app-id of another user.
4) The Conversations tab features all the existing conversations. The user can start a new conversation by clicking on the button and selecting the contacts, he/she wants to add in the same conversation. Thus this acts like the Whatsapp Group feature.
5) The user can now send messages in a conversation to one or many people simultaneously.
